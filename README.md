# Compressor Decompressor
Compressor and Decompressor is a Java-based Desktop application built using the Java Swing toolkit. Objective of the project is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression technique. The application primarily provides the following two utilities:

1. Compress files with no data loss(Lossless compression is essential to ensure data is not lost while compressing).
2. Decompress the compressed files(restoring the compressed files to their original form).

# Compressor
File compression allows the user to obtain a compressed version of a file which has its own benefits. Some of the benefits of compression include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs. The conversion here is lossless ensuring that no data is lost during the conversion of file.

# Decompressor
The compressed files can be restored through the process of decompression, whereby the user can retrieve the original file when required. 

This allows the users to easily compress and decompress files at will, when required, without any data loss.

# Instructions to run the Project locally
1. Open the project folder (Compressor Decompressor) in any IDE or code editor such as IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse, etc.
2. Run the java file at the location /Compressor Decompressor/src/GUI/Main.java. This file contains the main function and therefore the project can be executed by running the specified program file.
3. The application will load in a new window.
